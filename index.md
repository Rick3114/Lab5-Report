## Student Question:
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**\
I am working on a windows computer, using visual studio code, running the commands on the terminal, and the folder contains the files; grade.sh, GradeServer.java, ListExamples.java, Server.java, TestListExamples.java.

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**\
